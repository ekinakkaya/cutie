> _cutie_ as in cute and small.

This will be a cute interpreter based on the book [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I highly recommend you to check it out, since it introduces a lot of concepts in the computer engineering world which are usually ignored.

I am building this project to learn about interpreters, compilers and language design.

Also I aim to make this interpreted language as something that is capable of more complex tasks.

Such as training small machine learning models like the MNIST dataset. This will probably the end benchmark of this project.
